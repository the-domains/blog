**It's officially 2015, and we're deep in development mode here at The Grid, driving towards release in late spring (Northern Hemisphere). **

We recently [open sourced design guidelines for The Grid website][0], a collection of Photoshop assets designed by our Creative Director, Leigh Taylor. The response we received was astounding (and [crushed the Dropbox download limits][1]).

Also in case you missed it - [in an interview with Startup Beat][2], our founder Dan Tocchini shared an important part of the underlying vision that fuels our team as we build out core features on The Grid:

_"Our initial market is the doers_---_the creatives, the artists, the entrepreneurs_---_people who have the most immediate need for great, responsive websites that don't cost an arm-and-a-leg. But The Grid isn't just for businesses, it's for humans who want more than a cookie-cutter social media profile to represent themselves..._**_The Grid is a great business tool, but only because it's a great tool for humans first_**_."_

On that note, we want to hear from you---our Founding Members---as you're playing an important role in shaping the future of what we're building. What inspired you to become a Founding Member?
