**Founding Members,**

Two weeks ago, we added our first group of Founding Members into The Grid beta, and sites are being created! Many of you have asked how long beta will be, who gets in, and when the next wave of beta access will be released, so we wanted to go through and answer your top questions directly. Here they are, in no particular order:

1. ******How many Founding Members are currently in beta?**
2. 100\.
3. 4. ******What kinds of sites can be built on The Grid right now? Can we see some of them?**
5. Most sites built on The Grid currently are a single page feed or blog style layout. We're not quite at the point where we can build eCommerce or gallery based sites, but we've made great strides with the influx of content from our beta testers over the last few weeks, and we're confident that more varied site types will be on the horizon soon. We'll be sharing beta sites with you as we continue to work on tuning the output from The Grid's AI engine (and you can get a sneak peek at one of our internal sites in the team hangout video below).
6. 7. ******Wait, but wasn't thegrid.io built on The Grid? Why don't all beta sites look like that?**
8. Creating a unique look and feel for one site is much different than creating a site that is unique for every one of our 50k+ Founding Members. While thegrid.io _was _built on The Grid, it was at a point when we had one design system up and running. With the endless variations that are in the engine now, our current focus is on refining the output so that the color, typography, and layout systems all work in perfect harmony. The Grid's AI will learn and grow as we put more and more content through, so it will continue to improve over time.
9. 10. ******When will the next round of beta testers get access?**
11. As soon as we make our first 100 beta testers happy. We hope to have all of our Founding Members in as soon as possible, but until we get through this first round we can't predict how long beta will be - it's possible that the beta testing process could last anywhere from 3-6 months, with our goal being to increase the size of each beta wave as we progress. For more on our "100 Happy Users" goal, check out the video below from our Chairman and co-Founder, Brian Axe. 
12. 13. 14. 15. ******I have a site I've been waiting to build on The Grid, should I keep waiting?**
16. We understand that some of you may be on timelines that require you to choose another website platform, and we are truly sorry for the wait. We are eager to get you onboard and using The Grid too! As we've mentioned in previous updates, we are granting all Founding Members an additional six months free on your one-year subscription to The Grid, and hope that the extra time will (in some small part) help make up for the delay. If you have a site that is integral to running your business or currently generating a high amount of traffic, we'd recommend waiting to switch your site over to The Grid until after beta is complete.

We'll be keeping you posted on The First 100 and how testing is going in the coming weeks. In the meantime, we know you've been wanting to hear more from us (and we love hearing from you!) so with that in mind, a few of our team members hopped on an impromptu Google Hangout to talk about what we've been working on recently. This was an experiment (and we'll keep doing them if you like seeing them) so here it is, raw and unedited:

Keep an eye on your inbox and on Twitter [@thegrid][0] for more like this!

With Love,

The Grid Team
