**Founding Members,**

**Yesterday, we invited the first official wave of 100 Beta users onto The Grid. **

We know---100 people isn't a lot. But it's still a big step. Because those 100 people are going to take the Beta and use it. Get mad at it. Break it. They'll tell us where it falls short, flies high, what it lacks and where it leads them. And The Grid will just continue to improve.

**So...what's next?**

Once we've got 100 happy users, we'll be ready for the next wave. And we'll be increasing the number of invitees with each wave; soon it will be thousands at a time. 

As Beta progresses, The Grid (and the websites it designs) will get better and better. That means that those of you later in the process will get a more polished version of The Grid to test.

**As a reminder, we won't be starting the clock on your one year subscription until Beta is complete.** And you'll still get an extra six months free on your subscription to The Grid.

You guys are the best. And we know you've been anxious to hear from us. So we wanted to send you a little video hello from the team. We hope you enjoy watching it as much as we enjoyed making it.

With Love,

The Grid Team
