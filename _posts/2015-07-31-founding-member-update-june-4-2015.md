**Founding Members,**

Since our [last update][0], we've made quite a bit of progress and wanted to give you a snapshot of some of the most exciting developments on The Grid. **This is a long one, so get comfortable, settle in with a cup of coffee (or tea), and read on.**

In the last few weeks, we've been focused on a few of the key design systems that together make up what we fondly refer to as the Multiverse, one of the driving forces behind The Grid's AI. Today we're giving you an inside look at the first two systems, what we like to call ColorVerse and TypographyVerse, along with a first look at our recently released API Documentation.

**COLORVERSE**

ColorVerse is an algorithm that extracts colors from a photo, image, or logo and creates thousands of possible color palette combinations. Instead of painstakingly choosing individual colors for your design palette, **you can upload a photo that has the color characteristics that resonate with your brand, and The Grid automatically constructs a color palette that fits perfectly with your site content. **

This type of color detection is extremely hard to do, even with a sophisticated algorithm---a simple color extraction will not work, because you may end up with dark, illegible text on a dark background. The technology behind ColorVerse is specifically engineered to account for all those edge cases so your site is beautifully designed, legible, and in harmony with the content you upload. 

In the video below, our Founder and CEO Dan Tocchini walks you through the internal tool we use to help tune the algorithm that The Grid utilizes to expertly select your color palette:

**TYPOGRAPHYVERSE**

TypographyVerse is the system that automates how The Grid chooses fonts for your site. Rather than picking individual typefaces for your headers, sub-headers, and body text, **you can****use the type slider to choose the feeling you're going for, and let The Grid do the rest. **You'll interact with the type slider just as you might with a designer---you can tell The Grid to find something that is "more playful", or "a bit more serious". 

Font selection is a cornerstone of great design, and something we take very seriously. Creating a cohesive typographic look usually requires studying the masters of design, and even then can be very tedious for the best designers. We've taken the time to classify thousands of possible typography decisions and sort them from formal to informal, which means fonts are always selected and applied in a manner that respects classic typography principles. The Grid will choose a distinct, but harmonious family of fonts to use for the entire text block or section, so no matter the mood you're going for, you'll end up with a cohesive look. 

**Given just a dozen or so typefaces, TypographyVerse creates 100,000 plus possible variations, ensuring that your site will always be uniquely yours**. And from the start, we're building in support for many different languages, even those that are read right to left like Arabic and Hebrew. 

Check out the video below for a tour of TypographyVerse by one of our lead developers, Jon Gold:

**THE GRID API**

For all you developers out there, we recently released documentation on [The Grid API][1], which will enable you to build applications on top of The Grid Platform. 

There are no artificial limitations in The Grid API; all the capabilities that the official Grid apps use are available, and anyone with an active subscription to The Grid can access the API. Apps can be self administered at [http://passport.thegrid.io][2].

You can use The Grid API to import or synchronize content from existing data sources, whether it's your social media feed, existing sites, or an enterprise system used in your current business infrastructure.  

In the demo video below, another one of our lead developers, Jon Nordby, walks you through the ins and outs of importing content to your Grid site via our API. Examples include pulling in profile information (thanks [Tommi Enekel ][3]for this one), importing content from existing websites, and uploading images directly to your Grid site. All the demos were done using the live Grid API and backend system:

We can't wait to see all the exciting things you'll create with The Grid API---feel free to send us feedback directly from our [API Docs page][1], or drop us a line on twitter [@thegrid][4]. 

**NEXT UP**

We're still working on integrating the design systems highlighted above along with others in the Multiverse, and only have a trickle of Founding Members in Beta currently but hope to accelerate this soon. As we mentioned in our last email, Beta invites will be sent based off of your Founding Member number.

That's all for now, but keep an eye out for more updates in the coming weeks as we move closer to the next round of Beta release. As always, thank you for your support. 

Till Next Time,

The Grid Team
