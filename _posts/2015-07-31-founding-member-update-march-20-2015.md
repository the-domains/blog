**Founding Members,**

SPRING IS HERE

**Spring has arrived in the Northern Hemisphere, which we know begs the question, "When will The Grid launch?"**

We plan to invite Founding Members by waves into a rolling beta as spring comes to an end in June. Remember, the earlier you signed up and the more referrals you've earned, the sooner you'll be invited.

In the meantime, we have a few updates to share with you---a sneak peek at The Grid in action, new details on our mobile apps, and a first look at our limited edition Founding Member Grid token. 

**The Grid Demo At Social Media Week New York**

Our Founder and CEO Dan Tocchini held the first public demo of The Grid at Entrepreneur's _Startups to Watch _event at Social Media Week in New York City. This five-minute demo gives you a behind-the-scenes look at how The Grid site was built and showcases our browser extension that will allow you to easily share content from anywhere on the web.

**Android And iOS Apps Announced**

VentureBeat was the first to report that we'll be releasing native Android and iOS apps that will allow you to update your site and share content on the go. [Click Here to Read More][0]

**The Grid Token First Look**

We've been hard at work on the look and feel of our limited edition Founding Member Grid token, and are proud to give you a first look at the design. The Grid token will allow you to easily share your site with anyone with a simple swipe on any compatible NFC device. We expect to begin shipping tokens in May/June, and will be sending you an email in the next few weeks to collect your shipping details.

We're in the home stretch and will have more to share soon, so keep an eye on your inbox and on Twitter [@thegrid][1].

Let The Countdown Begin,

The Grid Team
