**Founding Members,**

_There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew._

_- Marshall McLuhan_

A huge thanks to all of you for being part of our crew.

When we launched The Grid pre-order campaign, we hoped to reach 3,000 Founding Members by the time we were ready for beta, with a pie in the sky goal of 10,000\. 

We are now 10x beyond that first goal, and are so grateful to have such a passionate and dedicated group of Founding Members on board. Seeing the community that all of you are building around The Grid has been beyond anything we could have ever imagined. 

After months of internal testing, we recently rolled out to a small group of beta testers, and the results have been enlightening. While "ship before you're ready" is a permanent part of startup vocabulary, it still needs to ship ready enough for a great experience. Early user feedback tells us we aren't ready to release the product to all 40,000 Founding Members by the end of Spring, and while we hate moving the goal post, we're confident that it's the right thing to do in order to give you the tools you need to build strong sites on The Grid. 

Our plan is to roll out beta access in waves based on your Founding Member number - invites will be sent in order of when you signed up. The next group of Founding Members will get access to the beta in June. 

**To be clear, we will not start the clock on your subscriptions until beta testing is complete. And as a thank you for your early support, we're going to credit you with an additional six months free on your subscription to The Grid.**

That's all for now, but as we get closer to launch we'll continue to send updates on our progress.

As always, keep an eye on [@thegrid][0] for the latest news (and GIFs, of course).

Signing Off From Spaceship Earth,

The Grid Team
