Founding Members, 

(GRID BEAR LOVES YOU)

A little under two months ago, our team huddled around a single monitor in the living room of the house we rented for launch week, waiting for the counter on thegrid.io to tick up. 

**And then it happened. **

Our first Founding Member joined. 

And another, and another, and another... 

If there's one thing we've learned over the last month and a half, **it's that there's nothing like the feeling of watching that counter go up**. Because it's so much more than just another number. It's a new Founding Member, a future-seeker - someone like you who is ready for The Grid to usher in the next evolution of web design. 

**As of this writing, we're up to 11,700+ Founding Members**, and we couldn't have done it without your incredible support. You're telling friends, family, colleagues (and anyone who will listen) about The Grid and we are so grateful. 

**We've paid out almost $20,000 in referral credits** ($32 for each Founding Member you refer!), and look forward to paying out even more. 

Thanks to you, this last month has been filled with some amazing milestones for our team: 

* We blew past our initial funding goal of $70,000 within the first 24 hours.
The Grid has been featured in Fast Company, Entrepreneur, CNET, Forbes, Wired, VentureBeat, and more. 
* There were 11,079 submissions to our \#jj Instagram contest this week. We spent a good amount of time on Monday sharing all the incredible images on our team hangout. 
* Our list of investors continues to grow: 
* Jerry Yang, Yahoo Founder with investments in Evernote, Wattpad, and Tango, and mastermind behind the multi-billion dollar deal between Yahoo and e-commerce giant Alibaba. 
* Greg Badros, Founder and CEO of Prepared Minds Innovations, and former Facebook VP of Engineering and Senior Director of Engineering at Google. 
* And just yesterday, TechCrunch released a new feature article on The Grid - read more here: The Grid Raises $4.6M For Its Intelligent Website Builder 

**LET'S KEEP THIS MOMENTUM GOING **

Share The Grid with your friends and get money back, just in time for the holidays. We'll send you $32 for for each Founding Member that signs up using your referral link, until your pre-order has been paid for. If you refer more than 3, new referrals will move you up the list for early beta access.
