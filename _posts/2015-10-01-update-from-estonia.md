Our very international team is in the heat of a hack-a-thon in Estonia, slaving 24/7 to rollout the mobile & web apps to the 60,000+ founders who believed in our team & vision. 
Right now we have to personally on-board every beta user one-at-a-time. 

Our iOS app is going through review in the App store right now & we expect to start auto-rollout to our founding members this month. 
Our launch has been almost too successful. The initial goal was but a few thousand founding members. We're now the most successful crowdfunding campaign for non-gaming consumer software to date. Top 20 highest funded crowdfunding project in general. 

What may not be obvious reading a few of the vocal users on social media is how over overwhelmingly positive the support we've received has been, and of course, everyone is anxious to get their hands on the Grid! With several millions of visitors hitting our site, we've reached a scale of audience that is both exciting & nerve-racking. If just 1.5% of our founding members are dissatisfied, that's 1,000 people I personally feel indebted too. The negative feedback has been less than that & we take each one to heart. After inviting the first couple hundred founding members into the beta at the end of spring this year, it was clear we needed more time, it has been frustrating for everyone, but the right decision. 

Happy birthday to our creative genius, Leigh Taylor And, happy belated birthday to Carl Chouinard the man who "plays with colors". 

We are eternally grateful to all the founding members that are paving the way for the members to come. 

- Dan Tocchini IV, Founding Member \#1
