# An update from Jon Gold who is working on The Grid's typography system: ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a1b15719-cdc1-41c7-9cf2-f37938dfef3c.png)

Hey! There's been a ton of chatter wanting to see what we're working on (and rightly so). 

I haven't shared anything I've personally been working on for a while - honestly it's a lot of plumbing and lot of algorithm-heavy stuff, \*but\* if you want to see the rawness behind the scenes, here goes... If you're not interested in technical details I'll try to do a non-technical writeup when I get some time. 

Anyway, today Vilson suggested I could model typefaces with a graph data structure. This is showing similar typefaces and suggested pairings (across Google Fonts, Fonts.com, Typekit etc). Graph output is super hard to read with this many data points (luckily it's for computers to read rather than humans), but this is a really powerful way of looking at typography (and I think it looks pretty cool!). 

Makes it possible, for example, for us to suggest free alternatives for excellent paid typefaces, or suggest a worthwhile paid upgrade to a free font that you've been using. Hope to make visualization prettier and interactive soon but I wanted to share it sooner rather than later smile emoticon 

A lot of 'behind the scenes' stuff, but I hope to be able to get this into the production algorithm soon!
