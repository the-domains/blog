> Google is to Machine Learning, as the Grid is to Constraint Programming.

"Machine" + "Learning" ... Oh, the beauty, the contrast, the tension of mechanical hardness possessed with the infinite fluidness of mind. ("Constraint" || "Logic") + ("Programming" || "Satisfaction" || "Solvers") ... No contrast, no inspiration inducing tension.

> Constraint Programming represents one of the closest approaches computer science has yet made to the Holy Grail of programming: the user states the problem, the computer solves it.

The chasm between the AI I learned at University & Hollywood's AI is like that between technology & magic. To the initiate, desensitized by years of servitude to the master behind the curtain, the "magic" is just maniacal perfection of the trade. AI to me was what textbooks like this so effectively described; a field in Computer Science that applies constraint satisfaction & machine learning to solve problems that previously required humans to solve. A traditional AI course begins with it's history, explains how constraint solvers can be used to solve seemingly impossible logic problems & proceeds to show how various machine learning algos are effective at solving technical problems rife with ambiguity, like if their's a face in a picture, or if something is attractive or not.
