# Launching Mission Control

> Don't wait for things to be perfect before you share them with others. Show early and show often. It'll be pretty when we get there, but it won't be pretty along the way. ― Ed Catmull,

## New Web Experience

We are at the tail end of a tremendous three-week long team meet up with our web app team here in San Francisco. Since we are [an unconventional startup][0]...a distributed team from all over the world, we have these team meet ups or what we call periodical "live-sprints." The "mission" of this live-sprint was to get our overhauled web app ready for people to test.

Why do this? Remarkable happens through an iterative process! When faced with a challenge as unprecedented like A.I.-Driven Website Design, the key is to get smarter in the process of putting the "Designer In The Machine."

The best way to supercharge getting smarter is to get feedback from people currently using The Grid. People are the essential ingredient in shaping a product that will one day delight beyond expectation. Based on that feedback, we pinpoint which parts of the product cause the most friction. These pain-points are the areas of the experience we, in turn, focus on in our effort to realize A.I.'s potential of creating a beautiful custom web presence for everyone.

After our initial closed beta launch to the first wave of Founding Members, we realized that the experience needed an overhaul. It was a long way from our value proposition: "As easy and enjoyable as using a social network." So we are making it clear, concise and speedy! In this new experience, we are committed to a coherent paradigm for interacting with the internet through The Grid. (see images below)

The Grid wants to make it easy to access resources on the web, Think of The Grid as a crystal goblet; it is clear so you can view the character of the wine that is poured into it. You can appreciate the depth of its color; its body and alcohol content by the legs it leaves on the glass and anticipate the flavor on your palate.

So, in order for you to develop your palate for the content you view on the internet and include in your website, much like connoisseurs would educate their palate to the wines they encounter in the marketplace, then ultimately include in their collections, we have introduced what we internally call "Grid Goggles" (more on that in the next blog post). The Grid Goggles are represented by an "ON" "OFF" switch in the upper right corner of the screen. When the switch is "ON," The Grid web interface allows you to peer into the elements and composition of the content and edit it to your tastes, as well as, share to multiple Grid sites. (In later iterations of the Beta the sharing will extend to social networks). When the switch is "OFF" you view the internet as you would through a normal browser.

## The Curator

We want our interface to be exciting and alive! So, unlike the unimaginative and bland UI"s on other platforms, The Grid's interface adapts to the content you add - a core principle that, up until now, we haven't achieved.

It is now easier to navigate between drafts "unpublished content" and feed "published content". The overall flow of building a website now simplified with a simple button where you can create content or become a curator of shared content.

## Say Hello to The Colorverse

A large image header will guide your experience with beautiful colors of your brand developed by our Colorverse System. Colorverse generates color values for major web experience elements like different kinds of text, buttons, icons, etc, and also generates color values for drop-shadows for each element & line dividers. We have applied Colorverse to The Grid's iOS, Android & Web apps, driving the colors of the application user experience to be adaptive to whatever site or media is in focus.

What is so innovative about this? Currently there is no platform or tools that can create multi-hue user interface with color solutions near the level of polish & dynamism as currently seen from Colorverse.

## A Better Poet

We realized that the "website problem" encompasses every facet of the user experience including and especially the subtleties of UI design that subliminally impact the user experience. Because of our core AI knowledge systems we can now do the unprecedented; build and maintain a dynamic UI color palette from your content. The goal is enhancing user experience beyond the status quo of today's solutions. While this hasn't been easy, we have doggedly maintained our commitment to creating a more beautiful internet - as revealed in our new post editor (see below).

## Coming soon: Mission Control Liftoff Part 2

In the upcoming weeks, we will be creating new videos and rolling out The Grid's new web experience. Until then wishing you all a wonderful week from all of us at The Grid.
