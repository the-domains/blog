  Thanks to the great support of our Founding Members we have come a long way at
  The Grid. Our earlier FMs have patiently tested and given us great feedback.
  This means our newer FMs are now getting access to an enhanced onboarding and
  user experience. More than 30,000 websites have been created on The Grid and
  our AI designer-in-the-cloud has done nearly half a million redesigns (more
  about that in future blog posts.) but MUCH more is coming. Gone are the days
  of logging in with social media, and you can now log in with your email
  address. There are some really exciting new features for you to try out, so
  whether you are an early FM or a more recent one, we encourage you to
  experience The Grid before we open up to the general public in the coming
  months.

# The Grid Beta Program

Thanks to the great support of our Founding Members we have come a long way at The Grid. Our earlier FMs have patiently tested and given us great feedback. This means our newer FMs are now getting access to an enhanced onboarding and user experience. More than 30,000 websites have been created on The Grid and our AI designer-in-the-cloud has done nearly half a million redesigns (more about that in future blog posts.) but MUCH more is coming. Gone are the days of logging in with social media, and you can now log in with your email address. There are some really exciting new features for you to try out, so whether you are an early FM or a more recent one, we encourage you to experience The Grid before we open up to the general public in the coming months.

## WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON FOR V2.0 RIGHT NOW

From your feedback, we've prioritized a few tops that we keep hearing from you.

**Navigation & Post Ordering**

You want your website visitors to have the best experience possible, and we want that, too. Local navigation is in the works so your page will be polished and well organized for easy navigation. Additionally, we know you want to have more control over how your posts are ordered, and you will!

**Perfecting Filters & Adding Photos**

We hear you photographers! We hear you, and we agree. True colors will shine through soon, and filters will be an option rather than a default.
