# Why AI?

_**"Now more than ever, in a world flooded with cognitive noise, the world needs simple, intelligent, integrated ecosystems of information. The sooner designers embrace this need, the better prepared we'll be for the future." -Sergio Nouvel**_

Yes, we believe in the vast potential of AI to do just about anything, but the good news is that Designers (web and otherwise) are far from becoming obsolete... Actually, quite the opposite! We think AI gives designers access to a new dimension of web design and that no AI is truly intelligent without human minds behind it. The beginning phases of the Grid may seem simple, but there have been many ideas and thoughts, a re-creation of those ideas, and then multi-level transformations of systems within those thoughts that it has been built on. As this process has unfolded, so has it become more and more apparent, the need for each design feature that supports the Grid's AI; Color systems, harmonious tiling, and content navigation, each have become their own entity... as will the modern day template or "filter" find a new way of being on the Grid. We expect marketplaces for designers and other artists to spring up to create and sell their content on the Grid and cannot wait to see what organic development springs up from it!

So we thought we would give you a little behind the scenes as to what goes on with our AI designer.

# **[The Composer][0]**

It all starts with our machine learning algorithms that are part of one of our patents and several that are pending. It is The Grid's design system process what we call "The Composer" which encompasses seven different steps to the website creation that we can scale. This system's job is to generate a perceivably unique site design every time. It does so by harmonizing a complex set of typography, color, decoration, and layout decisions with a content's metadata, the content surrounding it, and user preferences.

## The AI ability to Scale.

The Composer can generate a website in less than 30 seconds. It is driven by a cloud infrastructure that supports autoscaling. This means during peak demand times, the number of workers is automatically scaled up and once the demand is back to normal, scales back down.

The Composer is one of the five key proprietary components to The Grid's Artificial Intelligence and we will be sharing more of that in upcoming blog post.
