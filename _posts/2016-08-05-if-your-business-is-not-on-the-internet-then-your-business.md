## _**"If your business is not on the internet, then your business will be out of business." - Bill Gates**_

Whether shopping online or looking for a business' address or phone number, people today often turn to the internet first for information about businesses and products --- making an online presence one of the most valuable assets for any business; not just to share information, but to build credibility.

According to a survey by [Weebly][0], 56% of the consumers surveyed said they don't trust a business without a website. Customers look to connect with companies digitally now more than ever, so establishing an online presence through a website, blog or social channels provides an excellent way for brands to do so. With a digital presence, brands can reach a broader audience than through traditional forms of communication, and they can continue to curate customer loyalty by remaining in constant contact with their brand advocates.

So, what are the options for businesses who want a website to reach their customers?

They're usually limited to the following options: 1) paying someone a bunch of money, 2) learning to do it oneself, or 3) buying a website template.

Yet, a recent article from the [Social Media Examiner][1] reveals that 44% of small businesses don't even have a website! Moreover, only 68% of those businesses update their websites no more frequently than once per month. So what's the problem?

# **Customer Problem**

## **Problem 1: Getting a website is too diﬃcult & time consuming**

**There's no solution as simple as a social network to get a website online. In comparison, getting a "good enough" website is too diﬃcult, time consuming & expensive --- so, most go without.**

**The numbers speak for themselves:**

* **88% of U.S. SMEs would choose a website over social media to represent them**
* **Over 50% of U.S. & Global SMEs do not have a website**
* **45% of those without a site say creating site is to expensive.**

## **Problem 2: Designing a website for mobile is necessary --- but also perceived as complicated.**

Although mobile-optimized sites are mandatory, roughly 70% of websites are not mobile ready. In addition, while there are many products on the market to create a website, there is not a simple or credible way to create and maintain a website _from_ a mobile device. This fact is mind-boggling, considering more people access the internet from their mobile devices than any other gadget.

Plus, now that search engines are shifting to create a more mobile-friendly experience, the fact that only 21% of those surveyed have a mobile version of their company websites shows there is a huge opportunity for small businesses to improve their customers' digital experience with their brands. Even in China, which has one of the highest mobile search rates in the world, only 45% of respondents reported having a mobile website.

## **Problem 3: Websites are not social**

Websites are not social. Imagine Facebook without a news feed. That's what websites are like today, which makes it diﬃcult to create lasting connections with one's audience. As a result, websites become inactive and invisible.
