# **Introducing The Grid for Everyone**

_**"The future is not a destination - it is a direction."**_

_**Ed Catmull**_

Unleashing creativity requires that we loosen the controls and be open to new possibilities. During our closed beta we gave the opportunity to more than 50,000 users from 180 countries to build Gridsites. The results informed us, guided us and has now led us to a place where we can make The Grid available to everyone. Grid beta users built sites to display their talents, express their passions, share experiences, connect with others and even sell stuff. They got to carve out their personal slice of the internet and and now anybody can do the same. We hope you will journey with us as we open up TheGrid for all humans to interact with their personal AI designer-in-the-cloud.

Your first step on the journey is to visit TheGrid.io. This site is built with a new Design System that we are testing internally and will be releasing to all users in the next few months. Design Systems are the way in which we bring variety and polish to Gridsites. We will publish a blog soon that goes into more detail about DS. The other new things you will notice on TheGrid.io are purposes or calls-to-action. These are now available to all Grid members. Over time we will introduce additional purposes. Again. Watch out for an upcoming blog on this topic.

We have a roadmap of product features we are working on including e-commerce, photo galleries, and collaborative publishing. Please visit our roadmap site _[here][0]_ and let us know how important these features are to you.
