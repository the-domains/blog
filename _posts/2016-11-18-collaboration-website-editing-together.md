# Collaboration: Website editing, together

Great things are rarely made in isolation. Only when we team up with others we can truly make our work shine. In the past, websites on the Grid could only be managed by one person -- until today: We're excited to announce Collaboration, making it possible to open your website content to as many contributors as you like.

In the modern multi-device world, collaboration comes in many flavors. If you're using one of our mobile apps, you may have already experienced collaboration in its simplest form: you can work on a Grid site on both your mobile device and desktop computer at the same time. With the new release, we've now enabled multiple users to do the same.

Using our [Android app][0], you can now invite your friends or colleagues to edit and publish content on your website, no matter if they're already a member of the Grid or not.

Collaboration is of course not limited to just the Android app. While inviting users is currently only available on that platform, collaborators can participate in managing your website using any of our client applications on Android, iOS, and the web.

With the collaboration feature, you can enable guest bloggers to write stories on your site. If you're an agency, you can build a client's website together with them. Or if you're running an event, you can let participants join in liveblogging.

Site collaborators can help to manage the website fully: edit content, publish new material, change the site logo and other settings, and request new redesigns [from Molly][1]. The only limitation we impose is that nobody else except the site owner is able to delete the website or change its address.

## Inviting collaborators

To add a collaborator to your website, simply open the Android app and hit the Collaborators button. You can invite as many collaborators as you like by choosing them from your contacts.

If the person you're invited already has a Grid account, the site gets added to their plan. If they're not on The Grid yet, they're automatically provided access to a free plan where they can collaborate but not create new sites.
