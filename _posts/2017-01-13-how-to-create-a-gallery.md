# How To Create A Gallery

You can create a gallery in The Grid editor by uploading 9+ images in one post. This will create a gallery of the images in that post. You can do a redesign to change the outcome, for example, to display your images in circles, columns, etc.

In order to create a gallery, the post has to be set to be on your Homepage. If it's only linked to Nav, and not set to show on your homepage, a gallery will not be created. [See this article about post settings.][0]

**If this is a deal breaker for you here's what you can do to both link to Nav and have a gallery:**

Use one of your other sites to create a Homepage that hosts your images, either in one post, as seen above, or in several posts. When you do this, it will style the page for you as a gallery, or as images in multiple posts. You can then Link to External Website in Nav on your main site, and link to your image gallery site.

# How to Create an Image Carousel

The way you upload your content can influence the AI's choice of design.

Check out this image carousel. It was created by uploading 3 large landscape images that were all in individual posts with a h1 header. The AI decided to group these together in a carousel. Watch this [video][1] from our Help Desk to learn more.
