data-reactid="56"><div class="Content" data-reactid="57"><p><strong>The Grid: </strong>What inspired you to start this business?</p><p><strong>Gridster:</strong> I have always been interested in the creative and arts world as long as I can remember. Growing up I wanted to be an architect, and I played guitar in a punk band. Music's influence over society and history intrigues me, and I love the creative struggle of architecture… the balance between the laws of physics and our limitless imaginations. Photography just evolved naturally out of those two interests. I like the physical challenges photography is bound to, as well as its potential to document, inform, and mold society. As I began to understand the camera, I couldn't imagine myself doing anything else.</p><p><strong>The Grid:</strong> Tell me about your career and the journey to where you are now?</p><p><strong>Gridster:</strong> After attending Columbia College in Chicago, I spent the next few years assisting other photographers around the country, learning from them, and just taking the time to develop my style. So many people want to make the jump to pro instantly, and I felt that it was critical to develop more as a person and artist before adding the pressure of trying to make a living from it. After several years of shooting personal work, clients began to come naturally from what I was doing. It was a little slower than I would have liked at times, but it also never felt forced, or like I was developing a style that wasn’t my own just for the sake of winning clients.</p><p><strong>The Grid:</strong> How do you want your website/work to make your visitors feel?</p><p><strong>Gridster:</strong> Like they understand how I see the world and relate to people. I shoot very narrative work, so I would hope that people have felt like they have maybe seen snippets of my subjects lives, and can relate to them. As I have gotten deeper into a certain subject matter like my Wyoming trip, and the coffee farmers, I hope that it helps people understand certain lives and cultures that we are completely unaware of, and maybe inspires someone to look further into it.</p><p><strong>The Grid: </strong>If you could eat only three foods for the rest of your life, what would they be?</p><p><strong>Gridster:</strong> Hmmm. Coffee, Sushi, and fruit smoothies… that might be cheating due to a number of foods within all of them.</p><p><strong>The Grid:</strong> If you had to leave earth on a spaceship and take two friends with you, who would they be and why?</p><p><strong>Gridster:</strong> Does my wife count against the two friends? Probably my friend and filmmaker Jordan Lehman. He has such an amazing perspective on the world, and a sense of social responsibility to use the camera to not only bring visual awareness to issues but as a potential to financially back change, not just document it. Most people don’t go beyond the first step of that process.</p><p><strong>The Grid:</strong> Which would you rather be: Vampire, werewolf, or wizard?</p><p><strong>Gridster:</strong> I suppose a wizard, only because most of them have English accents in the movies.</p><p><strong>The Grid: </strong>Which superpower would you choose: Ability to fly, invisibility, or power of persuasion.</p><p><strong>Gridster:</strong> Flight.</p><p><strong>The Grid:</strong> Would you rather be a genius, have unlimited wealth, or stunning beauty.</p><p><strong>Gridster:</strong> Seeing as I was born with the third, I would choose wealth. Not for my personal sake... I have little interest in being wealthy. Having the resources to tell stories, bring awareness, and leave a positive impact on society would be incredible. There are plenty of geniuses I could work with to make sure the wealth has maximum impact for those who need it most. Money is essentially a tool in the same way my camera is.</p><p><strong>The Grid:</strong> What Game of Thrones character do you relate to most?</p><p><strong>Gridster: </strong>I’m more of an Arrested Development kind of guy. I’ve never actually seen a single episode of the GOT.</p><p><strong>The Grid:</strong> Which one are you best at: Ideas, people, intuition/gut, or details?</p><p><strong>Gridster:</strong> I almost said “maybe gut” and then realized that wasn't very confident sounding. People. I have always been a people person, but Ideas is a close second. I think one informs the other… people and conversation inform new ideas. The two are pretty intertwined.</p><p><strong>The Grid:</strong> If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go and why?</p><p><strong>Gridster: </strong>Space, because it is the final frontier.</p><p><strong>The Grid:</strong> What does it mean to you to be a “Gridster”</p><p><strong>Gridster:</strong> It means I am part of a new community, and I like the sound of meeting new people.</p><p><em>Be sure to follow Seth on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sethlowephoto/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sethlowephoto">Twitter</a>.
