When the switch is “OFF” you view the internet as you would through a normal browser.","measurementHash":"4d9676a256e53c4db9e6cfa26b276948","length":801,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16},{"id":"67e0edab-66b8-4950-8148-3a6300c7518c","item":"974cc481-c858-46e3-807f-e149ac7ce61d","type":"text","html":"<p><strong>New Web Interface/Old Web Interface:</strong></p>","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":false,"source":"974cc481-c858-46e3-807f-e149ac7ce61d","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"New Web Interface/Old Web Interface:","measurementHash":"5d093284d3ba706a8bdd3816086893e1","length":36,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16},{"id":"6890282b-1981-46d6-8754-2d356608f196","item":"974cc481-c858-46e3-807f-e149ac7ce61d","type":"image","html":"<img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e186977abefe1fc0f3c93889c06ed36599825189.png\" title=\"New Web Experience Interface\">","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"datePublished":null,"inFeed":true,"isBasedOnUrl":null,"hasPage":false,"keywords":[],"user":"c8378102-05c9-47e9-9c8c-299d0ea732a7","dateModified":null,"title":"New Web Experience Interface","source":"fc31dcab-c78a-4559-83af-671f3782d119","publisher":{},"description":"","inLanguage":null,"inNav":false,"starred":false},"title":"New Web Experience Interface","cover":{"src":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e186977abefe1fc0f3c93889c06ed36599825189.png","animated":false,"exif":{},"colors":[[229,235,236],[23,22,28],[255,229,76],[131,127,110],[10,97,107]],"width":2374,"height":1268,"orientation":"landscape","ratio":"1024:547","aspect":1.8720292504570384,"imgflosrc":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e186977abefe1fc0f3c93889c06ed36599825189.png","rotation":0,"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[2.318359375,299.068359375],[2371.681640625,1265.82421875]],"confidence":0.674534,"center":[1184.681640625,992.2578125],"radius":1250.634328125},"faces":[{"x":2037.837890625,"y":1105.857421875,"width":55.640625,"height":55.640625,"confidence":5.010615},{"x":1912.646484375,"y":1184.681640625,"width":60.27734375,"height":60.27734375,"confidence":5.009333},{"x":825.3359375,"y":890.25,"width":97.37109375,"height":97.37109375,"confidence":5.003465},{"x":2086.5234375,"y":306.0234375,"width":111.28125,"height":111.28125,"confidence":5.000704},{"x":1810.638671875,"y":512.357421875,"width":55.640625,"height":55.640625,"confidence":4.999022}],"original":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e186977abefe1fc0f3c93889c06ed36599825189.png"},"measurementHash":"7f01dffffef8c00f967f3deec151b797","language":"en","measurementVersion":16},{"id":"33424efe-e52c-4f7f-9f6e-24f11438f9f8","item":"974cc481-c858-46e3-807f-e149ac7ce61d","type":"image","html":"<img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/96d9fb488f40e9874fb36617fcb06073c07614a9.png\" title=\"Old Web Experience Interface\">","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"caption":"","isBasedOnUrl":"","author":[{"name":"","url":""}],"user":"c8378102-05c9-47e9-9c8c-299d0ea732a7","title":"Old Web Experience Interface","coverPrefs":{"crop":false,"filter":false,"overlay":false},"source":"fc31dcab-c78a-4559-83af-671f3782d119","publisher":{},"description":"","starred":false},"title":"Old Web Experience Interface","cover":{"src":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/96d9fb488f40e9874fb36617fcb06073c07614a9.png","animated":false,"exif":{},"rotation":0,"colors":[[31,30,29],[223,223,223],[143,143,142],[84,227,108],[72,111,134]],"width":2223,"height":1220,"orientation":"landscape","ratio":"512:281","aspect":1.8220640569395017,"imgflosrc":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/96d9fb488f40e9874fb36617fcb06073c07614a9.png","saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[2.1708984375,162.8173828125],[2220.8291015625,1217.8740234375]],"confidence":0.250133,"center":[1141.892578125,748.9599609375],"radius":1207.2865517578125},"faces":[{"x":1895.1943359375,"y":870.5302734375,"width":52.1015625,"height":52.1015625,"confidence":5.011576},{"x":1908.2197265625,"y":939.9990234375,"width":52.1015625,"height":52.1015625,"confidence":4.998513}],"original":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9ca7eb02e8ced2b9eaeaf3753d42876cb1520d55.png"},"measurementHash":"568a3f7dc28617f43947b72c5e0e6a9c","language":"en","measurementVersion":16},{"id":"51ff82ad-95c5-4fa1-adbb-8a5f3cb5952d","item":"974cc481-c858-46e3-807f-e149ac7ce61d","type":"h2","html":"<h2>The Curator</h2>","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":false,"source":"974cc481-c858-46e3-807f-e149ac7ce61d","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"The Curator","measurementHash":"425113ee4ad184662d7d801053bc10f3","length":11,"measurementVersion":16},{"id":"5e84afee-0636-4a32-b85b-9e11b3e7f41c","item":"974cc481-c858-46e3-807f-e149ac7ce61d","type":"text","html":"<p>We want our interface to be exciting and alive!
