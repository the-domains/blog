            <title><![CDATA[The Grid Beta Program]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Grid Beta Program</h1><p>Thanks to the great support of our Founding Members we have come a long way at The Grid. Our earlier FMs have patiently tested and given us great feedback. This means our newer FMs are now getting access to an enhanced onboarding and user experience. More than 30,000 websites have been created on The Grid and our AI designer-in-the-cloud has done nearly half a million redesigns (more about that in future blog posts.) but MUCH more is coming. Gone are the days of logging in with social media, and you can now log in with your email address. There are some really exciting new features for you to try out, so whether you are an early FM or a more recent one, we encourage you to experience The Grid before we open up to the general public in the coming months.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/58347904-a501-403a-b1dc-a0945ab356b8.gif"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Small Business Owner’s Down-and-Dirty Guide to “Platishing”</h1><p>First off what is Platishing or a Platisher? The phrase was coined by Jonathan Glick when he wrote an article called Rise of the Platishers. In his words it’s something in between a publisher and a platform — something that weaves together the strengths of both. So why is this happening now and why is it important.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cd82aa83ffeb8d67ce6bbf162a156302e4fbc53d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
