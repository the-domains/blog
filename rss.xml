            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Grid - Spring Is Here</h1><p>Spring has arrived in the Northern Hemisphere, which we know begs the question, "When will The Grid launch?" We plan to invite Founding Members by waves into a rolling beta as spring comes to an end in June. Remember, the earlier you signed up and the more referrals you've earned, the sooner you'll be invited.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/96b2f3162b0f191ced8acbe090a514e0f62f5e7c.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Grid - Beta Update & Survey</h1><p>That's just it though: trying to teach a newborn system how to think about color is... well, also crazy. Because color theory is hard. It's not just scientific; it's psychological. But see, we're crazy enough to try it. And you know what? It's starting to work. That's why we're excited, not scared.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/09baf0a4a37d05ff7d1ed467b742ab4cf45bec33.jpg"></article>]]></description>
