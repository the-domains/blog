            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Grid - Beta Update & Survey</h1><p>That's just it though: trying to teach a newborn system how to think about color is... well, also crazy. Because color theory is hard. It's not just scientific; it's psychological. But see, we're crazy enough to try it. And you know what? It's starting to work. That's why we're excited, not scared.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ca20d6fa01136c38b8a0fb7ec940e63bcfdb2578.jpg"></article>]]></description>
